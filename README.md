# Heat Equation Solvers in C++

This codebase provides illustrative examples of solving the heat equation in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using C++. Our approach to solving the heat equation leverages both the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and periodic boundary conditions.

This repository is designed for educational purposes, with the goal of providing clear, easy-to-understand code for those interested in numerical methods, using heat transfer simulations as an example.

Features
- **Dimensionality**: Includes examples for solving the heat equation in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions
- **Numerical Methods**:
  - **FEM** Implementation: Utilizes the Taylor-Young expansion to approximate solutions, offering an intuitive approach to the Finite Element Method.
  - **FVM** Implementation: Employs a method akin to FEM but uses fluxes for computation. This approach ensures a flux calculation by simulating a finite element difference calculation at the interface.
- **Initial state**: By default a circle/sphere of high temperature is set, but the init function can be customized.
- **Boundary Conditions**: By default, periodic boundary conditions are applied, but it can be changed to set static boundary conditions.

<!-- This repository provides basic heat equation codes in C++ for 1, 2 and 3 dimensions. It uses finite element difference method (FEM) or finite volume difference method (FVM) discretization using the Taylor-Young formula with periodic boundary conditions. -->

## Usage

The procedure is the same for all dimensions. Let's say X dimension (replace X with a number between 1 to 3)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fm16191/heat_equation
$ cd heat_equation
# Compile the code
$ make heat_Xd
# Execute
$ ./heat_Xd
# Visualise
$ python3 plot_Xd.py [output.txt]
$ python3 out_to_paraview_Xd.py [output.txt]
```

## Examples

```bash
make
./heat_1d -x 100 -t 2000 -o data1D_100x_2000t.txt
./heat_2d -x 500 -y 500 -t 3000 -d 1.272e-4 -w 100 -o data2D_gold_500xy_3000t.txt
./heat_3d -x 80 -y 80 -z 80 -t 5000 -d 1.272e-4 -w 100 -o data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt
```

Above are three examples :
- A 100 points simulation over 2000 timesteps with output to `data1D_100x_2000t.txt`
- A 500 by 500 points simulation of 3000 timesteps, for a gold material (thermal diffusivity of 1.272e-4), with output each 100 timesteps to `data2D_gold_500xy_3000t.txt` (31 data dumps)
- A 80 by 80 by 80 points simulation of 5000 timesteps for a gold material(thermal diffusivity of 1.272e-4), with output each 100 timesteps to `data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt` (50 data dumps)

## Visualisation
After executing one heat_equation code for the dimension X, execute the `plot_Xd.py` with the output filename resulting from the simulation

Better visualise it with Paraview ..
> It currently uses CSV files, which isn't ideal, and it should be updated to use VTK files at some point.

```bash
$ py out_to_paraview_3d.py data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt
Simulation dimensions are 80 x 80 x 80
Simulation has 50 steps
80 80 80 512000 512000
...
CSV files written to "csv_data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt/"

$ ls csv_data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt/
data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt_000.csv
...
data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt_049.csv
```

Open Paraview :
- open the `csv_data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt/data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt_..csv` group, select **CSV reader** and leave default settings, click apply
- add a **TableToStructuredGrid** filter on `data3D_gold_80xyz_5000t.txt_00*`, 
- on **whole extent**, set on the right column of the table the dimensions of the simulation, minus one (eg. here it will be 79 79 79 on right column).
- on **x,y,z columns**, set x, y, z
- on representation set to **Volume** for example, and **t** for coloring and click apply
